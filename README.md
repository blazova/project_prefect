This is a project to test Prefect.io ETL workflows and orchestration use case following Prefect's [docs](https://docs.prefect.io/core/getting_started/basic-core-flow.html).

- `simple_flow.py` shows how to use prefect

- `etl_tutorial` follows a proper use case, builds specific and more robust ETL steps of the flow
